      "message": "It might be time to remove the _$DEBIAN_VER suffix. I think we left it in originally because there is always the possibility that we again need to build parallel versions (although we should try to avoid that), but I think there are less cumbersome ways.\n\nI would suggest to set the DEBIAN_VER parameter at the top and remove the suffix. If we set the variable for each image and use it to create the image tag (removing the hard-coded uses in the Dockerfiles), we would also always be clear about, which container image is based on which debian version.\n\nThis can be of course done in a separate change :-).",
