We cannot use the normal pipeline because it would be visible and therefore leak data about a security fix currently in development.\n\n\u003e - why are so many files deleted compared to auto-merge ?\n\nWe don\u0027t build/validate anything other than the security fixes. That\u0027s the reason behind the deleted files.",
