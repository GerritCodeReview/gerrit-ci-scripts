      "message": "FYI: The \u0027not relevant\u0027 state is a passing state like \u0027successful\u0027. It means that a required check doesn\u0027t block if being in this state. From what I understood, Result.NOT_BUILT occurs when the check doesn\u0027t need to run, which is exactly what \u0027not relevant\u0027 is for. I\u0027m just wondering if Result.ABORTED and Result.UNSTABLE are like that.",
