As long as we don\u0027t show the description of a checker in the checks table, it would be helpful if the name is as expressive as possible while being short and concise. By the way, the name is allowed to contain blanks and may start with a capital letter. ;-)\n\nI think I would rather prefer something like \"Build/Tests\" instead of \"notedb\" and \"ReviewDb Build/Tests\" for \"reviewdb\". (I left out \u0027NoteDb\u0027 for the former as it should be the default now and in the future.)",
