      "message": "True, but I also don\u0027t like to stuff to much stuff into the master container image, if it can be avoided.\nI would suggest to create a new slave-container based directly on slave-debian, which contains a set of python tools. Since we are starting to work with pipelines now, we become more flexible, since we can use multiple agents in a single job, allowing us to use several potentially smaller slave containers.\nIn the end, I planned to create such a slave anyway for the k8s-gerrit project at some point, since I use python for linting and testing as well. Maybe we can move this job to such a slave as soon as there is at least that additional use case for it. Until then the job might also do more than just lining the yaml-files, but maybe also rebuilding images etc..",
