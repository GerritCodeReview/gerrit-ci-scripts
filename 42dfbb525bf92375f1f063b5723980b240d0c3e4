For the beginning we decided to only activate RBE on master: branch:master. Later we would like to activate RBE also on stable branches (once we have fixed/understood remote cache misses issue).\n\nThat\u0027s why on stable branches, there is not RBE check exposed, and that\u0027s why TEST_TAG_FILTER should include the whole world of gerrit tests.\n\nIf we adapt the RBE checker, to also apply for stable-3.* branches, we would be able to do what you are suggesting.",
