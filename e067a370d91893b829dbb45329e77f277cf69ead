I see this documentation: [1]\n\n --spawn_strategy strategy\n This option controls where and how commands are executed.\n\n* standalone causes commands to be executed as local subprocesses. This value is deprecated. Please use local instead.\n* worker causes commands to be executed using a persistent worker, if available.\n\nThe question is why it has to be changed at all? Isn\u0027t it\u0027s the default? gerrit/.bazelrc has only this line (but it alsonot needed, as we removed closure library starting from 3.3 release).\n\n  --strategy\u003dClosure\u003dworker\n\nSo just remove --spawn_strategy option entirely?\n\n[1] https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html",
