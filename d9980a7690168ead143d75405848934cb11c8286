      "message": "As I commented in your change in Gerrit, IMHO it would be better to not maintain a virtual link to the closure-test via the template-test for the CI\u0027s sake. I think that just adds too much \"junk\" to maintain in the package.json for a long time. I would rather use the if-clause here, checking for which branch is built, to decide whether to use the template- or the closure-tests.",
