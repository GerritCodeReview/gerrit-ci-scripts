      "message": "This is relying on the documentation only having this test.  As David O mentioned in an earlier PS, this will mean we omit any new tests that get added later.\n\nHowever, as you\u0027ve found, Bazel will exit non-zero if there are no tests.  To get around that, we can check for the specific error code that Bazel returns on no-tests. See one of the recent changes by James Blair on the plugin verification for Zuul; this also had the same problem.",
