After investigation, it appears, that WCT for some reasons is trying to load babel runtime package that is missing:\n\n  /usr/local/lib/node_modules/web-component-tester/node_modules/regenerator-transform/lib/visit.js:9:31\n\nis trying to load: @bael/runtime parts.\n  \nAnyway, with this change the PolyGerrit tests are passing again.",
