      "message": "To perform tests we would need to use a Provisioned EFS: if we used bursting, the capacity would diminish as we test, until we ran out of credits.\n\nThe problems with creating and leaving a Provisioned EFS are:\n- Price: provisioned throughput EFS are more expensive and they will consume money even when we don\u0027t use them.\n\n- Cleanup and GC: our gatling tests are disruptive so leaving the EFS for re-use will cause subsequent test to work on repositories that have been used and modified already. We would need to clean up \u0026\u0026 GC before/after the tests or alternatively copy from an immutable repository stored on EFS and test against that.",
