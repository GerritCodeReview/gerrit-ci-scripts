      "message": "I thought we needed to specify the branch of the extra plugin dependency, hence this extra variable. However I don\u0027t think it will work this way.\n\nMaybe I can reuse the `{branch}` variable and add there the information about the extra plugin branch, i.e.:\n\n```\n- project:\n    name: multi-site\n    jobs:\n      - \u0027plugin-{name}-bazel-{branch}\u0027:\n          extra-plugins-names: \"pull-replication\"\n          branch:\n            - \"master*master\"\n            - \"stable-3.5*master\"\n            - \"stable-3.6*stable-3.6\"\n            - \"stable-3.7*stable-3.6\"\n```\n\nIn this case multi site will get `pull-replication` as a dependency as follow:\n* multi-site `master` will be built against pull-replication `master`\n* multi-site `stable-3.5` will be built against pull-replication `master` \n* multi-site `stable-3.6` will be built against pull-replication `stable-3.6`\n\n@Luca WDYT?",
