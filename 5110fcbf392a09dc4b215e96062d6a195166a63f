      "message": "Very good point. I have built all docker images from this change, and confirmed that Java 11 is installed only:\n\n  $ jenkins@90266cf550da:~/gerrit$ java -fullversion\n  openjdk full version \"11.0.5+10-post-Debian-1deb10u1\"\n\nAlmost all tests are passing. The two failing tests is a known issue:\n\n* //javatests/com/google/gerrit/acceptance/server/mail:MailIT\n* //javatests/com/google/gerrit/server:server_tests\n\nand we already have a special handling for those breakages. However, this specific handling is only active, if Java 11 tool chain is used. It is a small change to make the additional parameters also used if we build with default java toolchain, we just omit condition on java11 configuration parameter.\n\nThis is the change that fixed it: [1]. Now all tests are passing on docker image based on Debian Buster, with Java 11 installed only, without passing any parameters, also only with:\n\n  $ bazelisk test //javatests/...\n\nWe also probably want to move the fix: [1] to stable-2.16 branch.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/246604",
