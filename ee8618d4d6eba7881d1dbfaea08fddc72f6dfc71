      "message": "Since the error appeared on our setup of this project, which runs on internal servers, I can unfortunately not send you links. I am aware that jobs run fine on https://gerrit-ci.gerritforge.com/. When setting up jenkins using the initial configuration provided by this project, no Xvfb-installation is set under Global Tool Configuration \u003e Xvfb installation \u003e Xvfb installation installations. While no Xvfb is needed on the master, jenkins still uses the path defined here to find the Xvfb-installation in the docker slaves for some reason. \nI am not sure, why it works for you, but I could imagine that in your case this configuration might have been done manually at one point and was then persisted in your jenkins_home. If of course the option mentioned above is not set on your setup, there is probably something different on our system (e.g. PATH on the slaves).",

      "message": "Ok. Then I will look into that on our side.\nOf course we will support our private system ourselves. We decided to use this project as a base, since it is already a great setup to build and test Gerrit, which we need. While using it, we of course want to give back to the project. Thus, I was sharing changes, I needed to get it working for us and which seemed to me not directly related to internal conditions. Since I am new to the project, it is hard to judge, which changes are actually needed on your system, especially when I can only verify them on our system.\n\nSince it seems that there are still some basic issues leading to differences between the setups, I will rather discuss them in the mailing list in future, before submitting changes. Thank you for your comments and please excuse the inconveniences.",
