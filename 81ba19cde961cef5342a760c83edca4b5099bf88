We are not removing UI support for 2.16. GWT UI, that is still the main UI in this release, is still full functional and the Java-JUnit-tests are still validated during the CI build.\n\nRight, only PolyGerrit UI won\u0027t be supported anymore. That is quite surprising though as GWT is technically dead and unsupported, however, it will be the only supported and tested UI on v2.16 :-(\n\nI am wondering if we should then hold and discuss again.\n\n\u003e We also not removing or changing in any way PolyGerrit UI on 2.16 release. All what we are doing is to stop CI verification of PolyGerrit-UI changes, because it was using discontinued PolyGerrit 1 farmework and thus requires a special and outdated toolchain for CI verification: WCT on Chrome 60.x version and would significantly complicate Docker images support, with no real gain for this community.\n\nNot verifying \u003d not supporting.
