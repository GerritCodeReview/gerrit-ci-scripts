      "message": "Since we are using just one version of buck now, and this will probably not change in future, do we need that at all? We could just set the variable once, when building the docker image. This should work: ENV PATH\u003d\"/opt/buck-java/bin:${PATH}\"\n\nWe should probably keep the \u0027set-java.sh\u0027 script, since we probably will have to support multiple Java-versions in the future as well. Or can bazel deal with that in an easier way?",
