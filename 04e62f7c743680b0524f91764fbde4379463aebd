      "message": "Yes that is probably a good idea. I guess that there might be even more html-and js files, but wildcards should be fine.\n@Tao: Can you comment on how artifacts of pure UI plugins in general look like, so that we can find a good way to publish them?\nIf there are multiple files, it might be worth to zip them.",
