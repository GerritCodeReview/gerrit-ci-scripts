      "message": "How does this not work correctly? I tested it on your original change and it worked well. The job failed due to a codestyle violation in the build files detected by Buildifier, but the closure test and all other yarn/npm based tests were green. Also the logs showed that yarn correctly fell back to do an online installation as intended.\nAlso adding the dependencies in a previous change wouldn\u0027t change anything, because the new packages wouldn\u0027t be installed in the slave images yet. This would only happen with the next rebuild of the slave image.",
