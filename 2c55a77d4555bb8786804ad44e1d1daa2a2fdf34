      "message": "I am also not happy with this solution. Especially, since this is hiding what is done here from the logs.\n\nHowever, I wanted to avoid having to duplicate the scripts for building- and testing Gerrit, which I would have to do, if I want to use `export BAZEL_OPTS`(env variables set this way are not shared between build-steps :-( ).\nThe env-inject solution I used before worked, but the long line required in the yaml was annoying me (using `\u003e` to avoid that did not work).\n\nThus, since this script was still there, it seemed to be the most  straightforward thing to do.\n\nAnother solution may be to have a build step that writes these bazel options to a file, if Java11 is supposed to be used, which is in the late build steps added to the variable using `$(cat bazel.opts)` or just source it.",
