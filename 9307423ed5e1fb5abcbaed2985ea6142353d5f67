      "message": "Sure, we could add some `sed` command to do that, but I would think it would rather make sense to adapt the build to not fail in these cases, e.g. to ignore the devDependencies, if the package.json is provided by a plugin. This would then also prevent users building and testing plugins in-tree of running into that issue.",
