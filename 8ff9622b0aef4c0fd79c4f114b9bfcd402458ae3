      "message": "I had a look on that issue, problem is that we are copying jars from nested directories to bazel-bin/plugins/zookeeper-refdb/ I\u0027m not sure if that is needed. So we can do two things:\n1. Look for jars only in bazel-bin/plugins/zookeeper-refdb/ and skip subdirectories\n2. Do not copy jars to bazel-bin/plugins/zookeeper-refdb/ so basically remove this:\nDEST_JAR\u003dbazel-bin/plugins/{name}/$(basename $JAR)\n[ \"$JAR\" -ef \"$DEST_JAR\" ] || mv $JAR $DEST_JAR\n\nWDYT?",
