      "message": "End of life of Java 8 is January 2019. So, that Java 7 is more dead than alive. Currently we prevent upgrading slave docker image to debian stretch and still using outdated debian jessie, only because of Java 7, right?\n\nOne simplifcation I would like to suggest would be to remove Java 7 support from docker images, and build with buck on 2.12 and 2.13 stable branches with Java 8.\n\nIIRC, I\u0027ve built last time a patch for production system with buck on stable-2.13 and I havn\u0027t switched to Java 7 and used Java 8 and it just worked.\n\nMoreover, we could even set backwards compatibility in .buckconfig in gerrit tree:\n\n  [java]\n  source_level \u003d 7\n  target_level \u003d 7\n\n(Moreover, I think, that we this approach, we could even move directly to Java 11 and it would also work (as it would also work with Bazel, because it produces per default Java 8 target level).\n\n[1] https://buckbuild.com/files-and-dirs/buckconfig.html#java.source_level",
