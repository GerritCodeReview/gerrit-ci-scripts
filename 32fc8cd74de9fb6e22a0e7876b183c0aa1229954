      "message": "Yes, we could make the expression a lot more complicated, but it would then be subject to many more modifications moving forward.\n\nAlso, it would become very fragile as we add files/directories to the source tree.\n\nWe either accept this limitation OR just get rid of the Checkers auto-assignment logic and DO not assign any query string and leave to the pipeline to add the check as needed.\n\nAlso, the NOT_RELEVANT could be a workable workaround.\n\nAt the moment, it shows it as \"pending build\" which is very misleading.",
